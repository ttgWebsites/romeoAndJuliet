					<li data-theme="b">How does the short time frame of the play play a role? And is this time frame even plausible?</li>
					<li data-theme="d">The romance of Romeo and Juliet spans only four short days before the tragic end, however the events that occur during this short time period would suggest a much longer time frame.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Being that these events are crammed into such a short time frame it seems to add a sense of heightened drama as every brief moment is essential to the plot.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">The events also seem to be occurring so quickly that the characters do not have much time to react, and instead must go with the flow.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">This accelerated plot and romance also seems to play a role in the tragic end, as the characters must react so quickly that the results of their actions are out of their control.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">The pace of the play does not seem plausible as it seems as if a romance so intense as Romeo and Juliet's would require much more time to develop, however it is just that, a play, and therefore real life is thrown aside for the drama of the stage.</li>

					<li data-theme="c">She too is overwhelmed by a powerful love for Romeo, however hers is not as easily explainable as she has no experience with love, yet Romeo has an overwhelming effect on her.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">The new found love quickly causes Juliet to mature, and she proves that her feelings for Romeo are not an infatuation but true love.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">It seems that both of their personalities provide the perfect recipe for a powerful and captivating love, however it is a love that cannot quite be explained, nor should it be as it is so natural and undying.</li>
