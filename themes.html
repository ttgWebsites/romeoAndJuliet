					<li data-theme="d">Like many of Shakespeare's plays the idea of a predetermined fate is well established in Romeo and Juliet</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Even the characters are well aware of the idea of fate, and they often interpret what they believes are omens about their fate</li>
					<li data-theme="d">It seems that Romeo and Juliet are fated to not be together despite their love</li>
					<li data-theme="c">They are on opposite sides of a decades long feud</li>
					<li data-theme="d">They are urged to see other people and must keep their love secrets</li>
					<li data-theme="c">It seems that the only way they can be together is in the afterlife</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Romeo believes this fate, and is quick to kill himself when he believes Juliet dead, sure enough she kills herself as well</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Though they did not have to do this to be together, they accidentally do</li>
				</ul>
				
				<ul data-role="listview" data-inset="true">
					<li data-theme="b">Individualism vs. society's will</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Romeo and Juliet fall madly in love with first meeting however they must keep this love a secret due to the society they live in</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Their love is forbidden as their two families are in a constant feud</li>
					<li data-theme="d">One's loyalty to family, even the broad family of Montague and Capulet, outweighs one's individual desires</li>
					<li data-theme="c">We see at the end of the play the consequences of going against society</li>
				</ul>
				
				<ul data-role="listview" data-inset="true">
					<li data-theme="b">Love's power</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Romeo and Juliet's love for one another knows no boundaries</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Their love is so powerful that they are willing to sacrifice almost anything for one another despite the consequences</li>
					<li data-theme="d">They are both blinded by love so as to not even worry about their feuding families</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Their love results in both of their deaths as well as the needless deaths of others who stand in the way</li>
					<li data-theme="d">This goes to show that though love is often very positive, that it is a powerful emotion that can lead to consequences including violence if not handled correctly</li>
