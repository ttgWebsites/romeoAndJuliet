					<li data-theme="d">Romeo and Juliet is perhaps the most famous play written by Shakespeare. 
					This play is set in an Italian town divided by two warring factions. The house of Capulet and the house 
					of Montague have a long-standing hatred for one another that has often led to bloodshed. The protagonist 
					Romeo falls in love with a young girl of the opposite house, Juliet. Both fall madly in love but are afraid 
					of the consequences. The two decide to wed secretly in hopes of reuniting the two houses. A plan is set in 
					motion in which Juliet will be presumed dead and Romeo will find her in the burial chamber of her family where 
					he can take her away and live happily together. However Romeo is not informed of this and ultimately believes
					her to have died. He takes his own life, and she takes hers upon seeing this. Their love ironically does lead
					to the reuniting of the two houses and the ending of the feud.</li>
